  SLIDES: place greater emphasis on interfaces
    implementation inheritance
      the base Object class
        origin of equals / hashcode / toString
      the "is-a" pattern
        liskov subtitution?
      method and field reuse
      concrete vs abstract classes
      using extends
      overriding
      risks
        banana and jungle problem
        short term vs long term
        tight coupling
    interfaces
      the "does-a" pattern
      abstract methods/signatures
      default methods
      static fields and methods
      coding to an interface (public APIs)
      comparison to risks of implementation inheritance
    polymorphism
      examples from standard lib
      examples with custom classes and interfaces
  WALKTHROUGH: modeling the instructor / public figure
    use whiteboard
      list attributes and behaviors
      design with pure implementation and interface inheritance
      highlight issues with implementation inheritance
      highlight limitations of interface inheritance
      design with blended inheritance for best of both
    implement the design
      rotate around students having each contribute to writing some component
      instantiate and show usage
  STUDIO: very heavy class may not have time
    time permitting have students go through the same steps as walkthrough on their own
